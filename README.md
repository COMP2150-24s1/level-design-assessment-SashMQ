# COMP2150  - Level Design Document
### Name: [Sashwath Subramanian]
### Student number: [47415983] 

This document discusses and reflects on the design of your platformer level for the Level Design assessment. It should be 1500 words. Make sure you delete this and all other instructional text throughout the document before checking your word count prior to submission. Hint: You can check word count by copying this text into a Word or Google doc.

Your document must include images. To insert an image into your documentation, place it in the "DocImages" folder in this repo, then place the below text where you want the image to appear:

## 1. Player Experience (~700 words)
Outline and justify how your level design facilitates the core player experience goals outlined in the assignment spec. Each section should be supported by specific examples and screenshots of your game encounters that highlight design choices made to facilitate that particular experience.

### 1.1. Discovery
What does the player learn? How does your encounter and broader level design facilitate learning in a way that follows good design practice?

The player begins on the left side within my level design, which enables them to move towards the right. While moving forwards through the first section of the level, the player is introduced with basic obstacles such as spikes on the floor. This obstacle teaches the player to that they have to jump over them. This is followed up with a small pit on the floor that IF the player falls in, is able to jump out of. This pit is just at the threshold where the player can jump out so they player can get a grasp of their limitations on jump height. These simple jumps and obstacles have cleverly been placed on the first section of my level design to promote an easy learning experience in the beginning. This facilitates good design practice as it enables the players to learn at an easy pace during the beginning.

### 1.2. Drama
What is the intensity curve? How does your design facilitate increasing yet modulating intensity, with moments of tension and relief? 

At the beginning of my design there is small amount of intensity and drama. This is so that the player can be introduced to basic obstacles that will make them learn and master the basic skills required for the upcoming sections. The player is tested at the end of the beginning section with small platform jumps over acid to reach a checkpoint. These smaller platforms and larger gaps to jump over increase the drama as their newly acquired skill is being put to the test, which is then complimented with a sense of relief once the player gets the second checkpoint.

### 1.3. Challenge
What are the main challenges? How have you designed and balanced these challenges to control the difficulty curve and keep the player in the flow channel?

There a challenge at the beginning of my level design, where the player has to jump onto small platforms over pits of acid. This is meant to be a challenge to test the players skill, and provide a sense of relief once completing that section.

### 1.4. Exploration
How does your level design facilitate autonomy and invite the player to explore? How do your aesthetic and layout choices create distinct and memorable spaces and/or places?

## 2. Core Gameplay (~400 words)
A section on Core Gameplay, where storyboards are used to outline how you introduce the player to each of the required gameplay elements in the first section of the game. Storyboards should follow the format provided in lectures.

Storyboards can be combined when multiple mechanics are introduced within a single encounter. Each section should include a sentence or two to briefly justify why you chose to introduce the mechanic/s to the player in that sequence.

You should restructure the headings below to match the order they appear in your level.

### 2.1. Spikes
![Place any alt text here!](DocImages/SpikeStoryBoard.png)
I have introduced spikes at the beginning of Section 1 of my Level Design. This is because spikes are a basic obstacle that the player should get used to as they will be seing a lot of about throughout the rest of the level design.

### 2.2. Acid
Use this storyboard for 2.2 and 2.3:

### 2.3. Checkpoints
(For storyboard refer to 2.2 Acid Storyboard which contains checkpoint as well.)

### 2.4. Health Pickups

### 2.5. Keys

### 2.6. Moving Platforms

### 2.7. Passthrough Platforms

### 2.8. Chompers

### 2.9. Spitters

### 2.10. Weapon Pickup (Gun)

### 2.11. Weapon Pickup (Staff)

## 3. Spatiotemporal Design
A section on Spatiotemporal Design, which includes your molecule diagram and annotated level maps (one for each main section of your level). These diagrams may be made digitally or by hand, but must not be created from screenshots of your game. The annotated level maps should show the structure you intend to build, included game elements, and the path the player is expected to take through the level. Examples of these diagrams are included in the level design lectures.

No additional words are necessary for this section (any words should only be within your images/diagrams).
 
### 3.1. Molecule Diagram

### 3.2. Level Map – Section 1

### 3.3.	Level Map – Section 2

### 3.4.	Level Map – Section 3

## 4. Iterative Design (~400 words)
Reflect on how iterative design helped to improve your level. Additional prototypes and design artefacts should be included to demonstrate that you followed an iterative design process (e.g. pictures of paper prototypes, early grey-boxed maps, additional storyboards of later gameplay sequences, etc.). You can also use this section to justify design changes made in Unity after you drew your level design maps shown in section 3. 

You should conclude by highlighting a specific example of an encounter, or another aspect of your level design, that could be improved through further iterative design.

## Generative AI Use Acknowledgement

Use the below table to indicate any Generative AI or writing assistance tools used in creating your document. Please be honest and thorough in your reporting, as this will allow us to give you the marks you have earnt. Place any drafts or other evidence inside this repository. This form and related evidence do not count to your word count.
An example has been included. Please replace this with any actual tools, and add more as necessary.


### Tool Used: ChatGPT
**Nature of Use** Finding relevant design theory.

**Evidence Attached?** Screenshot of ChatGPT conversation included in the folder "GenAI" in this repo.

**Additional Notes:** I used ChatGPT to try and find some more relevant design theory that I could apply to my game. After googling them, however, I found most of them were inaccurate, and some didn't exist. One theory mentioned, however, was useful, and I've incorporated it into my work.
