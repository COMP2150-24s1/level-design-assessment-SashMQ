## 1. Player Experience (~700 words)
Outline and justify how your level design facilitates the core player experience goals outlined in the assignment spec. Each section should be supported by specific examples and screenshots of your game encounters that highlight design choices made to facilitate that particular experience.

### 1.1. Discovery
What does the player learn? How does your encounter and broader level design facilitate learning in a way that follows good design practice?

The player begins on the left side within my level design, which enables them to move towards the right. While moving forwards through the first section of the level, the player is introduced with basic obstacles such as spikes on the floor. This obstacle teaches the player to that they have to jump over them. This is followed up with a small pit on the floor that IF the player falls in, is able to jump out of. This pit is just at the threshold where the player can jump out so they player can get a grasp of their limitations on jump height. These simple jumps and obstacles have cleverly been placed on the first section of my level design to promote an easy learning experience in the beginning. This facilitates good design practice as it enables the players to learn at an easy pace during the beginning.

### 1.2. Drama
What is the intensity curve? How does your design facilitate increasing yet modulating intensity, with moments of tension and relief? 

At the beginning of my design there is small amount of intensity and drama. This is so that the player can be introduced to basic obstacles that will make them learn and master the basic skills required for the upcoming sections. The player is tested at the end of the beginning section with small platform jumps over acid to reach a checkpoint. These smaller platforms and larger gaps to jump over increase the drama as their newly acquired skill is being put to the test, which is then complimented with a sense of relief once the player gets the second checkpoint.

### 1.3. Challenge
What are the main challenges? How have you designed and balanced these challenges to control the difficulty curve and keep the player in the flow channel?

There a challenge at the beginning of my level design, where the player has to jump onto small platforms over pits of acid. This is meant to be a challenge to test the players skill, and provide a sense of relief once completing that section.

### 1.4. Exploration
How does your level design facilitate autonomy and invite the player to explore? How do your aesthetic and layout choices create distinct and memorable spaces and/or places?

## 2. Core Gameplay (~400 words)
A section on Core Gameplay, where storyboards are used to outline how you introduce the player to each of the required gameplay elements in the first section of the game. Storyboards should follow the format provided in lectures.

Storyboards can be combined when multiple mechanics are introduced within a single encounter. Each section should include a sentence or two to briefly justify why you chose to introduce the mechanic/s to the player in that sequence.

You should restructure the headings below to match the order they appear in your level.

### 2.1. Spikes
![Place any alt text here!](DocImages/SpikeStoryBoard.png)
The spikes were introduced in the beginning of section 1 in my Level Design. This is done because spikes are a basic obstacle that the player should get used to as they will be seeing them more commonly while progressing through the level.

### 2.2. Acid
Use this storyboard for 2.2 and 2.3:
![Place any alt text here!](DocImages/CheckpointAndAcidStoryboard.png)
The player encounters acid in section 1 of the Level Design. It is introduced early so that the player can learn how to maneuver around this obstacle as it is commonly used within the rest of my Level Design.  

### 2.3. Checkpoints
(For storyboard refer to 2.2 Acid Storyboard which contains checkpoint as well.)
The players 3rd encounter would be a checkpoint, showing them that if they die they wont be severely punished and sent back to the start. Instead the player will respawn at the checkpoint where I have seemed fitting to add them. These checkpoints have cleverly been placed so that players are provided with a sense of reliefe, and don't get overwhelmed by having to repeat a large amount of the level due to dying. But has also been placed in a way where there is not too many checkpoints to satisfy the players thirst for challenge.

### 2.4. Moving Platforms
![Place any alt text here!](DocImages/MovingPlatformStoryBoard.png)
The following encounters would show the players two different platforms. First being the Moving Platform. The first moving platform was placed above a pit of acid, it was simple and easy to give the player an introduction to how these platforms would function in the rest of the level. 

### 2.5. Passthrough Platforms
![Place any alt text here!](DocImages/PassThrougStoryBoard.png)
The second platform was the passthrough platform that was introduced early in the level. The passthrough platform was placed over a hole so the player was able to know that they were meant to go down in order to progress through the level.

### 2.6. Health Pickups
![Place any alt text here!](DocImages/HealthPickupStoryBoard.png)
Health pickups have been introduced in the middle and at the end of section one. This story board shows the health-pickup at the end of section one. It is placed after the player has completed a challenging part where they have to avoid spikes by carefully jumping past them in order to progress through the level. If the player was hit by one of these spikes, a health-pickup was placed at the end of the small part so they could restore their health and learn how health-pickups work.

### 2.7. Keys
![Place any alt text here!](DocImages/KeyStoryBoard.png)
There are three keys within the level-design as given, I have placed them throughout the level, 1 key in each section, 3 sections. The first key was given to them past a challenging spiked filled hallway that would reward them for completing such a difficult challenge.

### 2.8. Spitters
![Place any alt text here!](DocImages/SpitterStoryBoard.png)
Spitters were introduced to the player in Section 2. The player would have to go across a moving platform over acid while a spitter was shooting at them. This made the player learn how to dodge spitters while also being on the move.

### 2.9. Weapon Pickup (Staff)
![Place any alt text here!](DocImages/StaffStoryBoard.png)
The wapon pickup staff was placed in a small cave, seperated from the direction of the level. This offered the player a chance to explore. Once the player got the Staff they would gain the ability to kill Chompers and Spitters. 

### 2.10. Chompers
![Place any alt text here!](DocImages/ChomperStoryBoard.png)
Chompers were introduced after the player was able to get the staff. This enabled to player to learn how to chomper works, making the player leanr how to dodge them or use the staff to kill the chompers.

### 2.11. Weapon Pickup (Gun)
![Place any alt text here!](DocImages/PickupGunStoryBoard.png)
The gun was introduced in the third section of the level, this enabled to the player to use long range moves to kill enemies. The third section of the map is very open and this compliments the use of a gun.

Justificaiton of why I introduced these mechanics in this order:


## 3. Spatiotemporal Design
A section on Spatiotemporal Design, which includes your molecule diagram and annotated level maps (one for each main section of your level). These diagrams may be made digitally or by hand, but must not be created from screenshots of your game. The annotated level maps should show the structure you intend to build, included game elements, and the path the player is expected to take through the level. Examples of these diagrams are included in the level design lectures.

No additional words are necessary for this section (any words should only be within your images/diagrams).
 
### 3.1. Molecule Diagram

### 3.2. Level Map – Section 1

### 3.3.	Level Map – Section 2

### 3.4.	Level Map – Section 3

## 4. Iterative Design (~400 words)
Reflect on how iterative design helped to improve your level. Additional prototypes and design artefacts should be included to demonstrate that you followed an iterative design process (e.g. pictures of paper prototypes, early grey-boxed maps, additional storyboards of later gameplay sequences, etc.). You can also use this section to justify design changes made in Unity after you drew your level design maps shown in section 3. 

You should conclude by highlighting a specific example of an encounter, or another aspect of your level design, that could be improved through further iterative design.

### Tool Used: ChatGPT
**Nature of Use** Finding relevant design theory.

**Evidence Attached?** Screenshot of ChatGPT conversation included in the folder "GenAI" in this repo.

**Additional Notes:** I used ChatGPT to try and find some more relevant design theory that I could apply to my game. After googling them, however, I found most of them were inaccurate, and some didn't exist. One theory mentioned, however, was useful, and I've incorporated it into my work.
