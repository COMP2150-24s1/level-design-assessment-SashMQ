## 1. Player Experience (~700 words)
Outline and justify how your level design facilitates the core player experience goals outlined in the assignment spec. Each section should be supported by specific examples and screenshots of your game encounters that highlight design choices made to facilitate that particular experience.

### 1.1. Discovery
What does the player learn? How does your encounter and broader level design facilitate learning in a way that follows good design practice?

The player begins on the left side within my level design, which enables them to move towards the right. While moving forwards through the first section of the level, the player is introduced with basic obstacles such as spikes on the floor. This obstacle teaches the player to that they have to jump over them. This is followed up with a small pit on the floor that IF the player falls in, is able to jump out of. This pit is just at the threshold where the player can jump out so they player can get a grasp of their limitations on jump height. These simple jumps and obstacles have cleverly been placed on the first section of my level design to promote an easy learning experience in the beginning. This facilitates good design practice as it enables the players to learn at an easy pace during the beginning.

### 1.2. Drama
What is the intensity curve? How does your design facilitate increasing yet modulating intensity, with moments of tension and relief? 

At the beginning of my design there is small amount of intensity and drama. This is so that the player can be introduced to basic obstacles that will make them learn and master the basic skills required for the upcoming sections. The player is tested at the end of the beginning section with small platform jumps over acid to reach a checkpoint. These smaller platforms and larger gaps to jump over increase the drama as their newly acquired skill is being put to the test, which is then complimented with a sense of relief once the player gets the second checkpoint.

### 1.3. Challenge
What are the main challenges? How have you designed and balanced these challenges to control the difficulty curve and keep the player in the flow channel?

There a challenge at the beginning of my level design, where the player has to jump onto small platforms over pits of acid. This is meant to be a challenge to test the players skill, and provide a sense of relief once completing that section.

### 1.4. Exploration
How does your level design facilitate autonomy and invite the player to explore? How do your aesthetic and layout choices create distinct and memorable spaces and/or places?

## 2. Core Gameplay (~400 words)
A section on Core Gameplay, where storyboards are used to outline how you introduce the player to each of the required gameplay elements in the first section of the game. Storyboards should follow the format provided in lectures.

Storyboards can be combined when multiple mechanics are introduced within a single encounter. Each section should include a sentence or two to briefly justify why you chose to introduce the mechanic/s to the player in that sequence.

You should restructure the headings below to match the order they appear in your level.

### 2.1. Spikes
![Place any alt text here!](DocImages/SpikeStoryBoard.png)
The spikes were introduced in the beginning of section 1 in my Level Design. This is done because spikes are a basic obstacle that the player should get used to as they will be seeing them more commonly while progressing through the level.

### 2.2. Acid
Use this storyboard for 2.2 and 2.3:
![Place any alt text here!](DocImages/CheckpointAndAcidStoryboard.png)
The player encounters acid in section 1 of the Level Design. It is introduced early so that the player can learn how to maneuver around this obstacle as it is commonly used within the rest of my Level Design.  

### 2.3. Checkpoints
(For storyboard refer to 2.2 Acid Storyboard which contains checkpoint as well.)
Checkpoints are the third mechanic introduced, so that players know their wont be put back to the beginning when failing an obstacle. Checkpoints have been cleverly placed within Section 1-3 of the level design, so that players are given a sense of relief.

### 2.4. Moving Platforms
![Place any alt text here!](DocImages/MovingPlatformStoryBoard.png)
Moving platforms were the fourth Mechanic in section 1 of my level design. This was introduced with a combination of acid, the player would not be able to jump over a big acid pit, but because there are now moving platforms the player is able to get across safely.

### 2.5. Passthrough Platforms
![Place any alt text here!](DocImages/PassThrougStoryBoard.png)
Passthrough platforms were the fifth mechanic introduced within the Seciton 1 of my level design. The passthrough platform was placed over a hole so the player was able to know that they were meant to go down in order to progress through the level.

### 2.6. Health Pickups
![Place any alt text here!](DocImages/HealthPickupStoryBoard.png)
Health pickups have been introduced in the middle and at the end of section one. The story board above shows the health-pickup at the end of section 1. It is placed after the player has completed a challenging hallway covered in spikes. In a scenario where the player hit the spikes, they would be able to heal up after completing the challenging hallway. 

### 2.7. Keys
![Place any alt text here!](DocImages/KeyStoryBoard.png)
The seventh mechanic were keys. There are 3 keys so I have placed 1 in each section. The players first encounter a key at the end of section 1 to provide a sense of triumph because they have gotten past difficult obstacles and been rewarded with a key.

### 2.8. Spitters
![Place any alt text here!](DocImages/SpitterStoryBoard.png)
Spitters are the eight mechanic introduced to the player in Section 2. The player would have to go across a moving platform over acid while a spitter was shooting at them. This made the player learn how to dodge spitters while also being on the move.

### 2.9. Weapon Pickup (Staff)
![Place any alt text here!](DocImages/StaffStoryBoard.png)
The weapon pickup staff was the ninth mechanic. Once the player acquired the Staff they were now able to defend themselves from Spitters and the next mechanic.

### 2.10. Chompers
![Place any alt text here!](DocImages/ChomperStoryBoard.png)
Chompers were introduced after the player was able to get the staff. This enabled to player to learn how to chomper works, making the player learn how to dodge them or use the staff to kill the chompers.

### 2.11. Weapon Pickup (Gun)
![Place any alt text here!](DocImages/PickupGunStoryBoard.png)
The gun was introduced in the third section of the level, this enabled to the player to use long range moves to kill enemies. The third section of the map is very open and this compliments the use of a gun.


## 3. Spatiotemporal Design
A section on Spatiotemporal Design, which includes your molecule diagram and annotated level maps (one for each main section of your level). These diagrams may be made digitally or by hand, but must not be created from screenshots of your game. The annotated level maps should show the structure you intend to build, included game elements, and the path the player is expected to take through the level. Examples of these diagrams are included in the level design lectures.

No additional words are necessary for this section (any words should only be within your images/diagrams).
 
### 3.1. Molecule Diagram

### 3.2. Level Map – Section 1

### 3.3.	Level Map – Section 2

### 3.4.	Level Map – Section 3

## 4. Iterative Design (~400 words)
Reflect on how iterative design helped to improve your level. Additional prototypes and design artefacts should be included to demonstrate that you followed an iterative design process (e.g. pictures of paper prototypes, early grey-boxed maps, additional storyboards of later gameplay sequences, etc.). You can also use this section to justify design changes made in Unity after you drew your level design maps shown in section 3. 

You should conclude by highlighting a specific example of an encounter, or another aspect of your level design, that could be improved through further iterative design.

### Tool Used: ChatGPT
**Nature of Use** Finding relevant design theory.

**Evidence Attached?** Screenshot of ChatGPT conversation included in the folder "GenAI" in this repo.

**Additional Notes:** I used ChatGPT to try and find some more relevant design theory that I could apply to my game. After googling them, however, I found most of them were inaccurate, and some didn't exist. One theory mentioned, however, was useful, and I've incorporated it into my work.
